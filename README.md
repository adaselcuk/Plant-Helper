# Houseplant Helper

I have 8 plant children whom I love dearly but sometimes forget to care for properly due to my university workload. To record any information regarding their care, their watering schedule, and other facts about the plants, I am creating an app, primarily to notify me when they should be watered according to each plant's specific care.


## What I am learning through this

This is my first app that I am developing, primarily intended for desktop use. However, I aim to also make this available for an IOS phone app. I want to learn how to use Flutter, the programming language of Dart, how to publish this app, and understand how to add new features. 

Moreover, I am particularly interested in UI as I completed a visual arts program in high school, I want to learn how to make apps as intuitive as possible. 

Since this is primarily intended for personal use, I will take great enjoyment for learning.
